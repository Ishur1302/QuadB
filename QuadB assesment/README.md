Here’s a new README.md for your React Native Netflix Clone project:

React Native Netflix Clone

This is a Netflix clone app built using React Native. The app features multiple screens such as a Splash Screen, Home Screen, Search Screen, and Details Screen. It fetches movie data from the TVMaze API and showcases the movies in a Netflix-like user interface.

Screens Overview

Splash Screen
    •    The app starts with a splash screen that displays a relevant image, setting the theme for the app.

Home Screen
    •    The home screen displays a list of movies and TV shows fetched from the API: https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=all.
    •    Each movie displays its thumbnail, title, and a brief summary.
    •    Tapping on any movie takes you to the Details Screen.
    •    A Search Bar at the top of the screen allows users to search for movies and is linked to the Search Screen.

Search Screen
    •    The search screen provides a search bar for users to search for any movie.
    •    The API used is https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=${search_term}, and results are displayed similarly to the Home Screen.

Details Screen
    •    The details screen shows detailed information about the selected movie or TV show.
    •    It includes the title, summary, poster image, and additional information.
